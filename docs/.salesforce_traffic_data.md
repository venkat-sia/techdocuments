Salesforce traffic data 
---

Current State
---

- there is NO salesforce admin portal where the traffic data for the sales force store can be downloaded or viewed
- doubt there will be even any API when they dont show it in their own portal
- Our Performance marketing team uses the google analytics to view and download the traffic reports

Solution
---

To explore the tracker approach (Option 1)
---

 - develop a tracker 
 - install it in the salesforce stores
 - things to consider 
    - valiram should also agree to install our tracker scripts 
    - maintenance of the tracker code 

Link the google analytics account (Option 2)
---
 - streamline the google analytics integration 
    - google analytics has account and property

    - looks one property for one salesforce store

 - fix the google analytics data pipelines if any issues with the current ones
 - link the google analytics property to the salesforce store (Option 2)
    - it is similar to currently we link the marketing channel to the store

    - we can do the same for google analytics
