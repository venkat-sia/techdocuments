Sales force traffic data 

Current State
---

- there is NO salesforce admin portal where the traffic data for the sales force store can downloaded or viewed
- doubt there will be even any API when they dont show it in their own portal

- Our Performance marketing team uses the google analytics to view and download the traffic reports
