Shopee Global Current State 
---
- **Global SKU and all the country SKUs are the same**

**Product Listing**

*Product creation / Listing*
- Upload the products to the global / cross border accounts
- Publish to which ever country the products need to be published
- upload to the cross border, publish to the individual country
- do we need to automate the publishing? 
- **product creation can only happen in the global**
- Shopee does the auto translation, auto conversion of the product data while publishing the product from the global to individual countries

*Edit Listing*
- Manual update of price for the products in each country
- Manual edit of product title ,description as auto translation does not work most of the cases 

*Reports*
- There are individual country specific seller centres 
- for campaigns you can only download it through country specific seller centres
- the reports are available at all stores and individual stores.
- more metrics are available at the country specific stores 

**Order View in the Seller Centre**	
- Order view 
  - by country (store currency)
  - global view also exist (CNY/account preferred currency)

Solution

- **Store Integration**
  - one siteNickname for global store
  - one siteNickname for country specific store 
 ```
    "shopee" : [
        {
            "nickName" : {
                "id" : "shopee-gloabl-1",
                "value" : "global"
            },
            "enableOrderPolling" : false as the order polling will 
            happen with country specific stores / shop ids
            "enableBulkListing" :true
            "enableBulkEditing" :true
