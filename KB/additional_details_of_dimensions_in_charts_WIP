Problem
---
 - Current charts can display only one dimension for any metric 
 - additional information about the dimension value is not displayed
 - _some basics_
    - metrics are the quantitative 
 measurements of data
      - examples 
         - revenue
         - number of orders
         - ads spend
         - ads revenue 
   - dimensions are the labels used to describe them
      - examples
         - stores 
         - country
         - state 
         - city
         - product sku
         - product title
- what could be the additional details of dimensions?
   - Examples 
      - nicknames to the indian cities names
         -  Athens of East , Madurai
         -  Pink City ,Jaipur
      - product title, product image to the SKU
